    "description": "This plug-in is used to move one or more APEX Button behind a Page Item. This is like the Plug-in \"Textfield with Buttons\" but you can use APEX Buttons, so you have full APEX Button and Theme Support. E.g. you got an Dialog Close Event when Close Dialog on Button Click.<p><b>Short info about \"Commercially Supported\"</b></p><p>My main job is at Kontron AIS Dresden GmbH, where I build our product https://equipmentcloud.de with Oracle APEX in the Oracle Cloud. In my spare time I like photography and develop free software. This software I make available to you free of charge and also give support as well as time allows! FOEX asked me if they can add some of my plug-ins to their \"APEX Plug-in Support Package\" program, for more information please visit: https://www.foex.at/plugin-support! This is an option you are welcome to take if you need commercial support! But you don't have to!</p><p>Also this plug-in remains free and open source under MIT license!</p><p>If you have problems with it, you can always create an issue on GitHub or contact me via social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn...). The commercial support for this plug-in by FOEX is only an additional option for you. So you can choose choose what you want! </p>",
