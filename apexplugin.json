    "description": "This plug-in is used to move one or more APEX Button behind a Page Item. This is like the Plug-in \"Textfield with Buttons\" but you can use APEX Buttons, so you have full APEX Button and Theme Support. E.g. you got an Dialog Close Event when Close Dialog on Button Click.<p><strong>Short info about \"Commercially Supported\"</strong></p><p>This software is available to you free of charge and I also give support as well as my time allows! FOEX asked me if they can add some of my plug-ins to their \"APEX Plug-in Support Package\" program, for more information please visit: https://www.foex.at/plugin-support! This is an option you are welcome to take, if you need commercial support! But you don't have to!</p><p>Also this plug-in remains free and open source under MIT license!</p><p>If you have problems, you can always create an issue on GitHub or contact me via social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn...). The commercial support by FOEX is only an additional option for you. So you can choose what you want!</p><p><b>Important clarification: My work in the development team of Oracle APEX is in no way related to my open source projects or the plug-ins here on apex.world! All plug-ins are built in my spare time and are not supported by Oracle!</b></p>",
