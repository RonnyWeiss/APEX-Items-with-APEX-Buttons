    "description": "<p><b>Description</b></p><p>This plug-in is used to move one or more APEX Button behind a Page Item. This is like the Plug-in \"Textfield with Buttons\" but you can use APEX Buttons, so you have full APEX Button and Theme Support. E.g. you got an Dialog Close Event when Close Dialog on Button Click.</p><p><b>Short info about \"Commercially Supported\"</b></p><p>This plug-in remains free and open source under MIT license!</p><p>If you have problems with it, you can always create an issue on GitHub or contact me via social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn...). The guys at FOEX also offer commercial support for this plug-in. They added the plug-in as a part of their \"APEX Plug-in Support Package\", for more information please visit: https://www.foex.at/plugin-support. I thought this was a great idea and therefore the cooperation is a great thing for everyone. Because you get professional support if I don't have time to support you or if the guidelines in your company require professional support! So we have the best of both worlds and you can choose what you want!</p>",
